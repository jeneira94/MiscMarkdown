# My Process, Thoughts, and Reasoning

## Outline
- Planning and research: 1 hour
  - Reading through each user story and visualizing how the feature would be shown based on the description.
  - Getting to know the Veeva Help Site: how its structured, the style its taken form, language and tone, and some of the content to get to know the product itself.
  - Understanding the main question: *"What is supposed to be accomplished here?"*
  - By the way it's designed, I chose to add an extra optional step under each sub-heading of **Sections** that it pertains to. I added a link at the end of the step to point towards the new sub-heading under **Sections** to describe the help configuration in more detail. I find this necessary to add that new sub-heading because when the user (the admin) wants to search in the search bar of the help site, they can key in the keywords to get to this particular section much faster and simpler than trying to comb through the steps of the sections themselves (especially if they are adding the help content to existing sections).
- Writing rough draft: 30 minutes
  - Writing the bulk of the procedure and rough draft of the main key points to include in.
- Revision and final: 30 minutes
  - Rewrite to match the style, language, and tone of the help site.
  - Replicate the steps by visualizing with the provided reference site and design description: 
    - *"Does the flow make sense?"*
    - *"Does it address any concerns that the users (admins or users with page layout access) may have?"*
  - Screenshots should be added after each added section to show how the dialog box would look for the built-in sections. I didn't add one for custom section because the custom ones would differ in look, based on who is creating it.

## Questions
- I had to assume, based on what I read, that the help configuration feature was a part of the **Add Section** dialog box even though the user story indicated that it was a **Section Help Configuration** dialog that is invoked by clicking on the Pencil Icon in the Page Layout Configuration next to the section. Both of these seem to clash because on [this site](http://vaulthelp.vod309.com/wordpress/admin-user-help/fields-objects/configuring-object-page-layouts/) that was provided in the writing exercise, if you go under **How to Edit Sections**, it is stated that it invokes the **Add Section** dialog, not the **Section Help Configuration** dialog. I chose to follow the design and steps that the site indicated over the writing exercise as it seemed to be the safer choice. _**So I'm wondering what was the design supposed to be?**_
- Another curiosity of mine about the feature was the user story also indicated the section help textbox title should have a text called "Show help to
viewers of this Section Learn More", but the step preceding it titled it as "Section Help". _**I was wondering how was this supposed to look like? Was the sentence mistakenly written as a textbox title as well or is it meant to be the description of the title "Section Help"?**_

Thank you for taking the time to look over my [writing exercise](sectionHelp.md).
