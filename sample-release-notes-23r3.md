### QMS

#### QualityOne Entry Action: Create Related Record

QualityOne adds a new entry action configuration that will automate creation of related records when the parent record enters in a particular lifecycle state. The **Create Related Record** action will run as an entry action for the admin-configured components available through the Related Record Setup tab.

#### Skip Checklist Assignment for Previously Assigned Checklists

This feature enhances the behavior of the existing _Manual Checklist Assignment_ user action available in the _Audit_ lifecycle. Triggering this action now will skip assigning checklists to previously assigned users in an _Audit Checklist_, avoiding duplicating checklist tasks for the same users and assigning checklists to any newly-added users. This creates more clarity for users working on a checklist and removes any confusion pertaining to duplicate tasks.

#### Supporting Multi-Batch Identification for COA

This feature provides Vault with additional capabilities to determine the number of batches in a single COA file during ingestion and analysis. Based on the number of identified batches, Vault will create one (1) _COA Inspection_ record per batch. Identifying multi-batch COA files allows customers to ingest a wider range of COA formats.
